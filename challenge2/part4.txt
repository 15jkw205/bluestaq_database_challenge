1) Add indexes - This would be the most effective approach to solving this problem. Add indexes for title, author_id, and genre. Full table scans will be less needed by doing this. Cuts down the search. 
2) Database caching - We could use an in-memory store like Redis to reduce the database queries for popular records. Access some data directly from cache rather than having to search through. 
3) Modify MySQL settings - Adjust the my.cnf file for MySQL. Focus on things like 'innodb_buffer_pool_size' and 'query cache_size_settings.'
